In this project, I created a pixel-sketch drawing board which is one of the odin Project's project. Through this project, I garner a lot of new lessons learnt. 

#Below are the experiences gained from this:
* deepened my understanding of CSS Grid, CSS FLexbox, and what it takes to make good looking UI
* learned how to use **mouseover** event and how to change functions based on the button clicked
* learned to overcome problems by struggling through as I believe the best long-term learning is the is what appears to be slow short term growth. 
* learned how to have sticky-footers 
* Learned to utilize google 
* learned how to make images into pressable buttons and style them in a good looking manner
* Develop familarity with commiting to *git*
* deepened knowledge on *DOM Manipulation*
